Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.: The agencies took up studies through a mixed method approach covering quantitative and 
qualitative	 data	 collection.	 A	 statistically	 significant	 sample	 size	 was	 covered	 under	 each	
project. | States: The major impacts recorded by the impact studies are as follows –
Horizon – I
	
Overall,	the	projects	assessed	under	Horizon-I	were	found	to	be	relevant,	effective,	efficient	and	sustainable.	They	
have not only contributed to higher incomes for farmers, but also enabled climate adaptation and conservation 
of natural resources. More importantly, their implementation was not affected because of Covid, wherein digital 
was	not	only	leveraged,	but	also	adopted	quickly	by	the	beneficiaries.
Climate Smart Agriculture:
 
Under Climate Smart Agriculture, the study covered Bihar, MP and Assam where post intervention, improvement 
was observed in average yields of major crops of wheat, maize, paddy and soyabean. Overall, 35% improvement 
was witnessed in wheat as compared to baseline and as against 13% reduction in control group, with highest 
increase of 81% observed in Begusarai. 
 
Overall increase in production for all major crops due to adoption of Climate Smart Agricultural practices was 
52% in the study conducted covering Maharashtra and Punjab. Among major crops (onion, sugarcane, wheat 
and paddy), highest increase in production was in onion (50%).
 
2.4 times and 5.3 times increase in awareness; and 3 times & 2.3 times increase in adoption of seed treatment 
practices in the model villages of Assam and Bihar, respectively. 
 
Integrated Pest Management Kit - Farmers appreciated the utility of phermone traps and 96% continued usage of 
the same in subsequent years after the project. The traps helped in reducing the number of rounds of pesticide 
spray (by 2-3 in number), thus saving costs to the tune of ` 6,000 to ` 8,000 per hectare.
	
Tray	seedlings	showed	up	to	99%	establishment	in	main	field	even	in	non-conducive	climate,	wherein	they	could	
withstand water stress and could give yield improvement of 12% to 17%. The barn roof insulations and turbo 
ventilators were instrumental in saving 25% to 28% of fuel wood.
Water Stewardship:
 
In the assessment conducted in select Districts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, improvement in water 
availability due to the Water Stewardship Programme resulted in an increase in average irrigated area by 7.5% 
post  intervention.  In  the  study  covering  Andhra  Pradesh,  Telangana,  Rajasthan,  Karnataka  and  Tamil  Nadu, 
99%  respondents  stated  that  the  project  had  resulted  not  only  in  reduction  in  water  consumption,  but  also 
improvement in income because of timely availability of water.

Table 83: | Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Revenue recognition | Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Revenue  from  the  sale  of  goods  (hereinafter  referred 
to  as  “Revenue”) 
is  recognised  when 
the  Company 
performs its obligation to its customers and the amount 
of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the 
consideration  is  probable.  The  timing  of  such  revenue 
recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control 
over the same is transferred to the customer, which is 
mainly upon delivery.
The 
timing  of 
revenue 
recognition 
is 
relevant 
to 
the 
reported 
performance 
of 
the  Company.  The 
management considers revenue as a key measure for

Table 84: | Key audit matters: evaluation  of  performance.  There  is  a  risk  of  revenue 
being recorded before control is transferred. 
Refer  Note  1 
to 
the  Standalone 
Ind  AS  Financial 
Statements  -  Significant  Accounting  Policies  and  Note 
21A / 21B.; How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Tested the effectiveness of such controls over revenue 
cut off at year-end. 
   On a sample basis, tested supporting documentation 
for sales transactions recorded during the year which 
included  sales 
invoices,  customer  contracts  and 
shipping documents.
   Performed  an  increased  level  of  substantive  testing 
in  respect  of  sales  transactions  recorded  during  the 
period closer to the year end and subsequent to the 
year end.
   Compared  revenue  with  historical  trends  and  where 
appropriate, conducted further enquiries and testing.
   Assessed  disclosures 
in 
financial 
statements 
in 
respect of revenue, as specified in Ind AS 115. | Key audit matters: Impairment assessment  of investment  in  WelcomHotels Lanka (Private) Limited (‘WLPL’), a wholly  owned 
subsidiary | Key audit matters: WLPL  is  developing  a  mixed-use  project  in  Colombo, 
Sri  Lanka  which 
includes  a  hotel  and  a  residential 
apartment  complex.  At  March  31,  2023,  the  carrying 
value of Company’s investment in WLPL is INR 2,775.41 
crores.  The  Company’s 
investments 
in  subsidiaries 
are  assessed  annually  by  management  for  potential 
indicators of impairment.
In  view  of 
the  deterioration 
in 
the  macro-economic 
scenario in Sri Lanka, the Company has assessed the 
carrying  value  of  investments  basis  evaluation  of  the 
recoverable value of the capital work in progress of the 
hotel (PPE) and inventory of the residential apartments 
being  developed  by  WLPL.  The  said  determination  is 
based  on  assumptions,  that  by  their  nature  imply  the 
use of the management’s judgement, in particular with 
reference to forecast of future cash flows, selling price, 
balance  cost 
to  complete 
the  project,  selling  costs, 
terminal  value, 
long-term  growth  rates  and  discount 
rates applied to such forecasted cash flows. Considering 
the  judgement  required  for  estimating  the  cash  flows 
and the assumptions used, this is considered as a key 
audit  matter.
Refer Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies and Note 
2 – Use of estimates and judgements to the Standalone 
Ind AS Financial Statements; How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Our audit procedures included the following:
   Evaluated 
the 
key 
judgements / assumptions 
underlying  management’s  assessment  of  potential 
indicators of impairment.
   Obtained and read the projections / estimated selling 
price / future cashflows along with sensitivity analysis 
thereof of the underlying PPE and inventory at WLPL.
   Discussed  and  obtained  assessment  of  recoverable 
value of PPE and inventory from component auditor 
of WLPL.
   Evaluated management’s methodology, assumptions 
and estimates used in these calculations.
   Involved 
valuation 
specialist 
to 
review 
the 
appropriateness of methodology and key assumptions 
considered by management to determine discounted 
future cash flows.
   Performed  sensitivity  analysis  around 
impact  on 
future cash flows due to changes in key assumptions 
considered by management.
   Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the future cash flow 
model including comparison with approved budgets.
   Assessed the recoverability of investment with regard 
to underlying value in use of PPE and net realisable 
value of inventory in WLPL.

Table 92: | Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Revenue recognition | Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Revenue from the sale of goods (hereinafter referred to 
as “Revenue”) is recognised when the Group performs 
its  obligation 
to 
its  customers  and 
the  amount  of 
revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the 
consideration  is  probable.  The  timing  of  such  revenue 
recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control 
over the same is transferred to the customer, which is 
mainly upon delivery.

Table 93: | Key audit matters: The  timing  of  revenue  recognition  is  relevant  to  the 
reported performance of the Group. The management 
considers revenue as a key measure for evaluation of 
performance. There is a risk of revenue being recorded 
before control is transferred.
Refer  Note  1 
to 
the  Consolidated 
Ind  AS  Financial 
Statements 
-  Significant  Accounting  Policies 
and  
Note 22A / 22B.; How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Evaluated the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of Group’s controls in respect of revenue 
recognition.
   Tested 
the  effectiveness  of 
such 
controls  over 
revenue cut off at year-end.
   On a sample basis, tested supporting documentation 
for sales transactions recorded during the year which 
included  sales 
invoices,  customer  contracts  and 
shipping documents.
   Performed  an  increased  level  of  substantive  testing 
in  respect  of  sales  transactions  recorded  during  the 
period closer to the year end and subsequent to the 
year end.
   Compared  revenue  with  historical  trends  and  where 
appropriate, conducted further enquiries and testing.
   Assessed  disclosures 
in 
financial 
statements 
in 
respect of revenue, as specified in Ind AS 115. | Key audit matters: Impairment  assessment  of  Capital  Work 
in  Progress  (Hotel)  and  valuation  of 
Inventories  (Residential 
Apartments) of WelcomHotels Lanka (Private) Limited (‘WLPL’), a wholly owned subsidiary | Key audit matters: WLPL  is  developing  a  mixed-use  project  in  Colombo, 
Sri  Lanka  which 
includes  a  hotel  and  a  residential 
apartment  complex.  At  March  31,  2023,  the  carrying 
value  of  Capital  Work 
in  Progress 
(‘CWIP’)  and 
inventories 
(excluding 
leasehold 
land 
value 
of  
207.08 
crores) 
is 
1,018.03 
crores 
and  
` 
` 
` 693.63 crores respectively. In view of the deterioration 
in 
the  macro 
-  economic  scenario 
in  Sri  Lanka,  
the  management  of  WLPL  has  performed  impairment 
assessment 
for 
its  capital  work 
in  progress  of 
the  
Hotel  (PPE)  and  net  realisable  value  assessment  for  
the inventory of the residential apartments. 
The  processes  and  methodologies  for  assessing  and 
determining  the  recoverable  value  of  the  project  are  
based  on  assumptions,  that  by  their  nature  imply  the  
use of the management’s judgement, in particular with  
reference to forecast of future cash flows, selling price,  
balance  cost 
to  complete 
the  project,  selling  costs,  
terminal  value, 
long-term  growth  rates  and  discount  
rates applied to such forecasted cash flows. Considering 
the  judgement  required  for  estimating  the  cash  flows  
and the assumptions used, this is considered as a key 
audit matter.
Refer  Note  1 
-  Significant  Accounting  Policies  and  
Note  2  -  Use  of  estimates  and 
judgements 
to 
the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.; How our audit addressed the key audit matter: Our audit procedures included the following:
   Obtained understanding of the Company’s policy on 
assessment of impairment of PPE and determination 
of net realisable value for inventory and assumptions 
used  by 
the  management 
including  design  and 
implementation of controls. 
   Obtained and read the projections / estimated selling 
price / future cashflows along with sensitivity analysis 
thereof. 
   Discussed  and  obtained  assessment  of  recoverable 
value of PPE and inventory from component auditor.
   Evaluated management’s methodology, assumptions 
and estimates used in the calculations.
   Involved 
valuation 
specialist 
to 
review 
the 
appropriateness of methodology and key assumptions 
considered by management to determine discounted 
future cash flows.
   Performed  sensitivity  analysis  around 
impact  on 
future cash flows due to changes in key assumptions 
considered by management.
   Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the future cash flow 
model including comparison with approved budgets.
   Assessed the recoverability of PPE with regard to the 
value in use and net realisable value of inventory.

Table 116: | S. 
No.: 1.; Material 
Issue 
Identified: Climate 
Change; Indicate 
whether 
Risk or 
Opportunity 
(R/O): Risk; Rationale for Identifying the 
Risk/Opportunity: Climate related physical and 
transitional disruptions may 
impact business operations, 
sourcing, supply chain and 
increase compliance costs.  
Potential Impact
• As average temperatures 
rise, extreme weather 
events are expected to 
grow in terms of severity 
and frequency which could 
have significant impact on 
the Company’s operations, 
its physical assets and agri 
value chains. These may 
lead to complete or partial 
outage of operations. 
Further, these events may 
also adversely impact the 
availability and quality 
of agri raw materials 
and consequently, the 
production and sales of the 
Company’s products
• Vagaries of weather caused 
by climate change impact 
crop cycles, output and 
productivity can result in 
disruption of operations/ 
supply chain
• Availability of water for 
own operations as well as 
farm value chains also can 
get impacted by erratic 
precipitation patterns; In case of Risk, Approach 
to Adapt or Mitigate: Physical Risk 
Management:
• Climate risk modelling 
for identifying high-
risk/vulnerable sites 
and agri value chains, 
and undertaking 
detailed assessments 
for developing locally 
contextual adaptation 
plans, risk mitigation 
strategies and 
undertaking measures 
for improving climate 
resilience
• Promotion of climate 
smart agriculture, and 
development of heat/
drought tolerant and 
high yielding varieties to 
improve productivity by 
adopting micro region-
specific agronomic 
practices
- Micro segmentation 
of growing zones and 
developing appropriate 
package of practices 
and precision farming 
techniques to mitigate 
impact of weather. 
- Enhancing climate 
resilience of farmers 
through capacity building 
programmes including 
leveraging ITCMAARS 
app together with the 
FPO (Farmers’ Producer 
Organisation) ecosystem, 
and supported by field 
demonstrations under 
Choupal Pradarshan 
Khets.; Financial 
Implications 
of the Risk or 
Opportunity 
(Indicate Positive 
or Negative 
Implications): -

Table 117: | Rationale for Identifying the 
Risk/Opportunity: • Besides physical risks, 
there are also transition 
risks associated with 
climate change, that can 
impact the Company’s 
operations:
- Additional levies may be 
imposed by regulatory 
authorities for emission/
water intensive industries 
to address climate change, 
which will lead to higher 
cost of compliance, and 
potential regulatory 
penalties and reputational 
risk in case of non-
compliance.; In case of Risk, Approach to 
Adapt or Mitigate: - Comprehensive 
programmes on social 
forestry, soil and moisture 
conservation and 
biodiversity conservation.
- Adoption of water 
stewardship approach to 
achieve water security for 
all stakeholders within the 
defined catchment areas of 
units located in high water 
stress areas.
• Diversification and 
contingency planning of 
supply chain
• Map risks arising out 
of climate crisis, build 
adaptive capacity and invest 
in mitigative measures to 
strengthen resilience across 
the value chain
Transition Risk 
Management:
• Continue to focus on energy 
conservation, improving 
energy productivity and 
enhancing the share of 
renewables in ITC’s total 
energy requirement as part 
of ITC’s Sustainability 2.0 
targets; strengthen enterprise 
sustainability and governance 
mechanisms for reviewing 
performance and progress 
against Sustainability 
2.0 targets through the 
Sustainability Compliance and 
Review Committee (SCRC)
• Adopt the Life-cycle 
Assessment (LCA) approach 
for identifying environmental 
impact across a product’s 
lifecycle; leverage the same 
for sustainable design and 
product innovation

No.: 2; Material 
Issue 
Identified: Product 
and Plastic 
Packaging; Indicate 
whether 
Risk or 
Opportunity 
(R/O): Risk; Rationale for Identifying the 
Risk/Opportunity: Inability to comply with 
current or future regulation 
on plastic packaging and/or 
failure to meet commitments 
on packaging and the 
environment. 
Potential Impact
• Non-compliance to plastic 
waste management 
regulations could lead to 
imposition of environmental 
compensation, that 
may negatively impact 
Company’s reputation; 
additionally, stricter 
government laws around 
usage of plastics including 
bans may give rise to 
multiple challenges such 
as redesign of product 
packaging, shelf life-
related issues and product 
distribution issues 
• Disruptions in the supply 
chain for recycled plastic 
or plastic packaging 
substitutes as required 
by law, can impact the 
Company’s ability to comply, 
produce and distribute 
products
• Inability to provide 
sustainable alternatives 
could have a negative 
impact on consumer 
sentiment; In case of Risk, Approach to 
Adapt or Mitigate: • Going beyond compliance 
wherever possible: 
- Ensuring plastic neutrality 
ahead of regulatory targets 
through source segregation 
programmes, creating 
replicable, scalable and 
sustainable models of solid 
waste management, and 
developing viable recycling 
options for Multi-Layered 
Plastic (MLP) packaging. 
- Ensuring that 100% of 
packaging is reusable, 
recyclable or compostable/
biodegradable.
• Partnering with upstream 
players and suppliers 
for ensuring supply of 
recycled plastic for meeting 
regulatory/market demand 
for increasing recycled 
content in plastic packaging 
• Harnessing the enterprise 
strengths of ITC (Life 
Sciences and Technology 
Centre, Paperboards & 
Specialty Paper Division 
and Packaging and Printing 
Division) in driving cutting-
edge innovation to offer 
sustainable alternatives to 
single-use plastics; pursue 
sustainable packaging 
initiatives like reduction in 
plastic packaging intensity, 
and improving recyclability 
of plastic packaging; Financial

(If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief): Yes, ITC’s Grievance Redressal Procedure is available to employees and workers. The objective of 
the policy is to facilitate open and structured discussion on employees’ work-related grievances 
with the intent of ensuring that the grievance is dealt with in a fair and just manner whilst being 
in compliance with the Company’s policies. ITC’s open-door practices encourage an amicable 
and fair resolution of grievances. Employees are encouraged to first discuss the grievance with 
their immediate reporting authority, and attempt to arrive at a resolution before invoking a formal 
grievance redressal mechanism.
In Unionised Units, grievances of workmen are also taken up for discussion by Union Office Bearers 
and resolved through dialogue with human resources managers and other designated managers. 
Units also have Committees with joint representation of workers and managers, which address 
grievances raised by one or more workers. In addition, many Units have forums where workers 
interact with the unit leadership team in small groups and share any suggestions or grievances they 
may have, for resolution.

business performance and/or reputation. In terms of the said Policy, the Company investigates such 
incidents, when reported, in an impartial manner and takes appropriate action to ensure that the 
requisite standards of professional and ethical conduct are always upheld. This Policy can be accessed
