Uncalled liability on investments is R 60.71 Crores (2022 R 54.89 Crores). (vi) Employee Benefit Plans Description of Plans The Company makes contributions to both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans for qualifying employees. These Plans are administered through approved Trusts, which operate in accordance with the Trust Deeds, Rules and applicable Statutes. The concerned Trusts are managed by Trustees who provide strategic guidance with regard to the management of their investments and liabilities and also periodically review their performance. Provident Fund, Pension and Gratuity Benefits are funded and Leave Encashment Benefits are unfunded in nature. The Defined Benefit Pension Plans are based on employees' pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits. (a) Defined Benefit Plans: The liabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. The Company makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation. Some Group companies also participate in these Plans. These participating Group companies make contributions to the Plans for their respective employees on a uniform basis and each entity ascertains their obligation through actuarial valuation. The net Defined benefit cost is recognised by these companies in their respective Financial Statements. Risk Management The Defined Benefit Plans expose the Company to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and salary costi inflation risk. Investment Risk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds - the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements. Interest Rate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plan liability is determined using the discount rate based on the market yields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa. Salary Cost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future salaries of participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities. These Plans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is designed based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes. The Trustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure that the health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans from future payment obligation. ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 189

These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation. While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the asset value changes may partially offset this impact. For presenting the sensitivities, the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the Defined Benefit Obligation presented above. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the Sensitivity Analysis from previous year.

Ind AS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' - This amendment has introduced a definition of 'accounting estimates' and includes guidance to help distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes' - This amendment has narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exemption SO that it does not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases. The same are applicable for financial statements pertaining to annual periods beginning on or after 1st April, 2023. Based on a preliminary evaluation, the Company does not expect any material impact on the financial statements resulting from the implementation of these amendments.

During the year, the net loss arising on such sale amounted to R 49.13 Crores (2022 - Nil) (Refer Note 22). Other Non-current liabilities other than lease liabilities due between one year to three years amounted to R 154.16 Crores (2022 R 94.99 Crores) and Other Non-current liabilities due after three years amounted to R 1.61 Crores (2022 R 6.05 Crores) on the reporting date. The maturity analysis of undiscounted lease liabilities are disclosed under Note 27(vii). Further, while the Company's total equity stands at R 67593.80 Crores (2022 - R 61399.57 Crores), it has non-current borrowings of F 3.28 Crores (2022 R 4.54 Crores). In such circumstances, liquidity risk or the risk that the Company may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they become due does not exist. Market Risk The Company is not an active investor in equity markets; it holds certain investments in equity for long term value accretion which are accordingly measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. The value of investments in such equity instruments as at 31st March, 2023 is R 1464.41 Crores (2022 R 1372.52 Crores). Accordingly, fair value fluctuations arising from market volatility is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. As the Company is virtually debt-free and its deferred payment liabilities do not carry interest, the exposure to interest rate risk from the perspective of financial liabilities is negligible. Further, treasury activities, focused on managing investments in debt instruments, are centralised and administered under a set of approved policies and procedures guided by the tenets of safety, liquidity and returns. This ensures that investments are made within acceptable risk parameters after due evaluation. The Company's investments are predominantly held in bonds/debentures, fixed deposits, certificate of deposits and debt mutual funds.

Other investments in bonds/debentures, certificate of deposits are fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss to recognise market volatility, which is not considered to be significant. Fixed deposits are held with highly rated banks and companies and have a short tenure and are not subject to interest rate volatility. The Company also invests in mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses. Such investments are susceptible to market price risks that arise mainly from changes in interest rate which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the mutual fund schemes in which the Company has invested, such price risk is not significant. For select agricultural commodities primarily held for trading, futures contracts are used to hedge price risks till positions in the physical market are matched. Such activities are managed by the business team within an approved policy framework. The carrying value of inventories is adjusted to the extent of fair value movement of the risk being hedged. Such hedges are generally for short time horizons and recognised in profit or loss within the crop cycle. Accordingly, the Company's net exposure to commodity price risk is considered to be insignificant. Foreign currency risk The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currency (mainly US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen) which are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including the Company's net investments in foreign operations (with a functional currency other than Indian Rupee), are also subject to reinstatement risks. The carrying amounts of foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities including derivative contracts, are as follows: (R in Crores) As at 31st March, 2023 USD Euro GBP JPY Others Total Financial Assets 694.77 87.30 18.42 0.27 14.88 815.64 Financial Liabilities 99.88 22.16 2.42 8.24 3.46 136.16 As at 31st March, 2022 USD Euro GBP JPY Others Total Financial Assets 565.80 75.16 40.00 0.01 0.98 681.95 Financial Liabilities 71.69 51.34 2.16 18.26 4.00 147.45 The Company uses foreign exchange forward, futures and options contracts to hedge its exposures in foreign currency arising from firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions. a.

Currency options that were outstanding on respective reporting dates (Designated under Hedge Accounting): (In Million) Currency Cross Currency Buy Sell Buy Sell US Dollar Indian Rupee 8.00 17.00 Hedges of foreign currency risk and derivative financial instruments The Company has established risk management policies to hedge the volatility in cashflows arising from exchange rate fluctuations in respect of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions, through foreign exchange forward, futures and options contracts. The proportion of forecast transactions that are to be hedged is decided based on the size of the forecast transaction and market conditions. As the counterparty for such transactions are highly rated banks or recognised exchange(s), the risk of their non-performance is considered to be insignificant. The Company uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Where such derivatives are not designated under hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of such hedges are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company may also designate certain hedges which are entered to manage the volatility in cashflows as a cash flow hedge under hedge accounting. The currency, amount and tenure of such hedges are generally matched to the underlying transaction(s). Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are recognised as cash flow hedging reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. While the probability of such hedges becoming ineffective is very low, the ineffective portion, if any, is immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The movement in the cash flow hedging reserve in respect of designated cash flow hedges is summarised below: (F in Crores) Particulars 2023 2022 At the beginning of the year 14.33 4.93 Add: Changes in the fair value of effective portion of matured cash flow hedges during the year (154.16) 16.71 Add: Changes in fair value of effective portion of outstanding cash flow hedges 17.81 19.27 Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on occurrence of forecast hedge transactions during the year (81.93) 30.07 Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss due to cash flows no longer expected to occur (28.19) 3.03 Less: Amounts transferred to initial cost of non-financial assets (10.40) (9.68) Less: Net gain/(loss) transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on Ineffectiveness (Less)/Add: Deferred tax 3.98 (3.16) At the end of the year 2.48 14.33 Of the above, balances remaining in cash flow hedge reserve for matured hedging relationships (11.20) 2.46 210 ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Once the hedged transaction materialises, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will be included in the initial cost of the non-financial hedged item on its initial recognition or reclassified to profit or loss, as applicable, in the anticipated timeframes given below: (F in Crores) Outstanding balance in Cash Flow Hedge As at As at Reserve to be subsequently recycled from OCI 31st March, 2023 31st March, 2022 Within one year 2.47 10.80 Between one and three years 0.01 3.53 Total 2.48 14.33 Foreign Currency Sensitivity For every percentage point increase/decrease in the underlying exchange rate of the outstanding foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts, holding all other variables constant, the profit before tax for the year ended 31st March, 2023 would decrease/increase by? 2.85 Crores (2022 -R 2.22 Crores) and other equity as at 31st March, 2023 would decrease/increase by 7 2.68 Crores (2022 R 42.87 Crores) on a pre-tax basis. Credit Risk Company's deployment in debt instruments are primarily in Government securities, fixed deposits with highly rated banks and companies, bonds issued by government institutions, public sector undertakings, mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses and certificate of deposits issued by highly rated banks and financial institutions. Of this, investments that are held at amortised cost stood at R 15420.01 Crores (2022 R 17732.33 Crores). With respect to the Company's investing activities, mutual fund schemes and counter parties are shortlisted and exposure limits determined on the basis of their credit rating (by independent agencies), financial statements and other relevant information. As these counter parties are Central/State Government, Government institutions/public sector undertakings with investment grade/sovereign credit ratings and taking into account the experience of the Company over time, the counter party risk attached to such assets is considered to be insignificant. The Company's customer base is large and diverse limiting the risk arising out of credit concentration. Further, credit is extended in business interest in accordance with guidelines issued centrally and business-specific credit policies that are consistent with such guidelines. Exceptions are managed and approved by appropriate authorities, after due consideration of the counterparty's credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions. The Company's exposure to trade receivables on the reporting date, net of expected loss provisions, stood at R 2321.33 Crores (2022 R 1952.50 Crores). The Company's historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognized, where considered appropriate by responsible management. The movement of the expected loss provision (allowance for bad and doubtful loans, advances and receivables etc.) made by the Company are as under: (F in Crores) Expected Loss Provision Particulars 31st March, 2023 31st March, 2022 Opening Balance 214.05 205.11 Add: Provisions made (net) (0.25) 11.71 Less: Utilisation for impairment/de-recognition 3.36 2.77 Effects of foreign exchange fluctuation Closing Balance 210.44 214.05 ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 211

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted price included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using market approach and valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates and forward rates at the end of the reporting period, yield curves, risk free rate of returns, volatility etc., as applicable. The fair value of investment in Bonds/Debentures, Certificate of Deposits, Venture Capital funds etc. and financial liabilities, where applicable, is determined using market observable inputs such as quotes from market participants, value published by the issuer etc. Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the fair value is determined using generally accepted methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparty. The fair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to the carrying amounts of these items due to their short - term nature. Where such items are non-current in nature, the same has been classified as Level 3 and fair value determined using discounted cash flow basis. Similarly, unquoted equity instruments where most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements, cost has been considered as best estimate of fair value. There has been no change in the valuation methodology for Level 3 inputs during the year. The Company has not classified any material financial instruments under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact on their value. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year. On behalf of the Board S. PURI Chairman & Managing Director S. DUTTA Director & Chief Financial Officer R. K.

Page 262 OCR: Enduring Value Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor's Report of even date on the Standalone Financial Statements of ITC Limited Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of ITC Limited ("the Company") as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI"). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Standalone Financial Statements A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference 224 ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Page 263 OCR: Enduring Value to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Standalone Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

Page 322 OCR: Enduring Value Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 28. Additional Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.) In respect of Surya Nepal Private Limited (SNPL), Excise, Income Tax and VAT authorities issued Show Cause Notices (SCNS) and raised demands to recover taxes for different years on theoretical production of cigarettes. In all these proceedings, the authorities applied an input-output ratio allegedly submitted by SNPL in the year 1990-91 and arrived at a theoretical production and demanded tax/duty on the differential production/turnover. This, despite the fact that SNPL's cigarette factory was under 'physical control' of the Excise authorities and cigarettes produced were duly accounted for and certified as such by the Excise authorities. The Revenue Authorities for the first time raised excise demands for the financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95, claiming that SNPL could have produced more cigarettes according to the input-output ratio submitted in the year 1990-91. SNPL challenged these excise demands before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal through a writ petition. A division bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal decided the matter in favour of SNPL (the "Division Bench Judgement") and rejected the above basis of theoretical production. The Ministry of Finance of Nepal filed a review petition before the Full Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal seeking review of the judgement of Division Bench. The Full Bench after hearing both the sides at length upheld the judgement of Division Bench by its order dated October 29, 2009. Similar demands had been raised for other financial years viz., Excise Demands for FY 1998-99 to FY 2002-03 and Income Tax demand for FY 2001-02, which were also challenged by SNPLI before the Hon' 'ble Supreme Court of Nepal by way of writ petitions and the Court was pleased to allow all the writ petitions setting aside the demands. Further, the Inland Revenue Department had decided administrative review petitions in favour of SNPL setting aside Value Added Tax demands for the financial years 2001-02 and 2007-08 and Income Tax demand for the FY 2005-06 following the aforesaid decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal. During the pendency of the aforementioned review petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal and thereafter, the Revenue Authorities raised demands and issued a SCN, in the same subject matter of theoretical production for different years (as listed below), which were also challenged by SNPL by way of writ petitions before Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal between the years 2007 to 2010: 1. Excise demand letters for R 17.38 Crores [Nepalese Rupee (NRs.) 27.80 Crores] relating to the financial years 2003-04 to 2006-07. 2. Excise Show Cause Notice for R 12.28 Crores (NRs. 19.65 Crores) relating to the financial year 2007-08. 3. Value Added Tax (VAT) demand letters for R 10.93 Crores (NRs. 17.49 Crores) relating to financial years 2002-03 to 2006-07. 4. Income Tax demand letters for R 13.45 Crores (NRs. 21.52 Crores) relating to financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04. SNPL's writ petitions with regard to various tax demands and a SCN mentioned hereinabove were disposed of by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal on 15th April, 2021 holding that SNPL should avail the alternate remedy by way of appeal to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). SNPL is currently pursuing legal remedy in line with the observations/directions provided in the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal. The Management considers that all the demands listed abovel have no legal or factual basis; accordingly, the Management is of the view that there is no liability that is likely to arise, particularly in light of the fact that the issue underlying these demands has already been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Nepal in favour of SNPL. No legal recourse is required tol be pursued in respect of a Show Cause Notice relating to the financial year 2007-08, since no demand has been issued. It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the closure of these issues and the consequential timings of cash flows, if any, in respect of the above. 284 ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

(b) Uncalled liability on investments is - 35.56 Crores (2022 R 29.74 Crores). (c) Commitments: Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital accounts and not provided for are - 2113.07 Crores (2022 - R 2228.44 Crores) for the Group, which includes share of joint ventures R 8.52 Crores (2022 - R 13.38 Crores). (v) Research and Development expenses for the year amount to R 161.36 Crores (2022 R 143.65 Crores). (vi) The Group has adopted Indian Accounting Standard-19 (Ind AS 19) on 'Employee Benefits'. These Consolidated Financial Statements include the obligations as per requirement off this standard except for those subsidiaries which are incorporated outside India who have determined the valuation/provision for employee benefits as per requirements of their respective countries. In the opinion of the management, the impact of this deviation is not considered material. Description of Plans The Group makes contributions to both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans for qualifying employees. These Plans are administered through approved Trusts, which operate in accordance with the Trust Deeds, Rules and applicable Statutes. The concerned Trusts are managed by Trustees who provide strategic guidance with regard to the management of their investments and liabilities and also periodically review their performance. Provident Fund and Pension Benefits are funded, Gratuity Benefits are both funded as well unfunded; and Leave Encashment Benefits are unfunded in nature. The Defined Benefit Pension Plans are based on employees' pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits. (a) Defined Benefit Plans: As per Actuarial Valuations as on 31st March, 2023 and recognised in the financial statements in respect of Employee Benefit Schemes: The liabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method as at year end. The Group makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation. Risk Management The Defined Benefit Plans expose the Group to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and salary cost inflation risk. Investment Risk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds - the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements. Interest Rate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plans liability is determined using the discount rate based on the market yields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa. Salary Cost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future salaries of participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities. These Plans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is designed based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes. The Trustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure that the health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans from future payment obligation. ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 285

Sensitivity Analysis The Sensitivity Analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible change of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation. While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the asset value changes may offset the impact to some extent. For presenting the sensitivities, the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the Defined Benefit Obligation presented above. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the Sensitivity Analysis from previous year.

Page 331 OCR: Enduring Value Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 28. Additional Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.) (vili)The Company on 7th April, 2023 divested its entire shareholding, i.e., 26.00% of the paid-up share capital, held in Espirit Hotels Private Limited (Espirit), consequent to which Espirit ceased to be a joint venture of the Company with effect from the said date. (ix) Under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA), Logix Developers Private Limited (LDPL) (CIN: U70101DL2010PTC207640) was to develop a luxury hotel-cum-service apartment complex. However, Logix Estates Private Limited, Noida, the JV partner communicated its intention to explore alternative development plans to which the Company reiterated that it was committed only to the project as envisaged in the JVA. The JV partner refused to progress the project and instead expressed its intent to exit the JV by selling its stake to the Company and subsequently proposed that both parties should find a third party to sell the entire shareholding in LDPL. The resultant deadlock has stalled the project. The Company's petition that the affairs of the JV are being conducted in a manner that is prejudicial to the interest of the Company and the JV entity, as also a petition for winding up of LDPL filed by Logix Estates, are currently before the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA), vide letter dated 6th July, 2022, cancelled the sub-lease for the land on which the project was to be constructed on account of non-payment of lease instalments and non-fulfilment of the conditions of the sub-lease, including forfeiture of the amount deposited. Upon cancellation of the sub-lease, LDPL is evaluating all options to pursue its rights. Consequently, as a matter of prudence, LDPL had de-recognised the leasehold land/assets as well as adjusted/reversed the lease liabilities towards NOIDA in accordance with the terms of the sub-lease, as an adjusting event in terms of Ind AS 10 - "Events after the Reporting Period" while approving its financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2022, on 29th September, 2022. As the accounting treatment pertaining to the aforesaid event was given effect to by LDPL in its financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2022 subsequent to the approval of the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31st March, 2022, the consequential impact has been considered in these consolidated financial statements.

Financial risk management objectives Entities comprising the Group have put in place risk management systems as applicable to the respective operations. The following explains the objectives and processes of the Company, being the largest component of the Group: The Company has a system-based approach to risk management, anchored to policies and procedures and internal financial controls aimed at ensuring early identification, evaluation and management of key financial risks (such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) that may arise as a consequence of its business operations as well as its investing and financing activities. Accordingly, the Company's risk management framework has the objective of ensuring that such risks are managed within acceptable and approved risk parameters in a disciplined and consistent manner and in compliance with applicable regulation. It also seeks to drive accountability in this regard. Liquidity Risk The Group's Current assets aggregate R 39670.89 Crores (2022 - R 34232.45 Crores) including Current Investments, Cash and cash equivalents and Other Bank Balances of F 22113.05 Crores (2022 - 16918.70 Crores) against an aggregate Current liabilities of R 13739.41 Crores (2022 - R 12163.71 Crores). As part of its surplus liquidity management operations, the Group may: sell instruments that are held at amortised cost. Such sales mayt be infrequent (even ifsignificant in value) ori insignificant in value both individually and in aggregate (even if frequent). During the year, the net loss arising on such sale amounted to R 49.13 Crores (2022 Nil) (Refer Note 23). Other Non-current liabilities other than lease liabilities due between one year to three years amounted to 7 304.94 Crores (2022 - 112.94 Crores) and Other Non-current liabilities due after three years amounted to - 115.42 Crores (2022 - R 36.41 Crores) on the reporting date. The maturity analysis of undiscounted lease liabilities are disclosed under Note 28 (xi). Further, while the Group's total equity stands at 7 69538.79 Crores (2022 R 62821.87 Crores), it has non-current borrowings of R 3.49 Crores (2022 - R 4.85 Crores). In such circumstances, liquidity risk or the risk that the Group may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they become due does not exist. Market Risk The Group is not an active investor in equity markets; it holds certain investments in equity for long term value accretion which are accordingly measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. The value of investments in such equity instruments as at 31st March, 2023 is - 1723.70 Crores (2022 R 1615.07 Crores). Accordingly, fair value fluctuations arising from market volatility is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. 306 ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Page 345 OCR: Enduring Value Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 31. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.) As the Group is virtually debt-free and its deferred payment liabilities do not carry interest, the exposure to interest rate risk from the perspective of financial liabilities is negligible. The Group's investments are predominantly held in bonds/debentures, fixed deposits, certificate of deposits and debt mutual funds. Mark to market movements in respect of the Group's investments in bonds/debentures that are held at amortised cost are temporary and get recouped through coupon accruals. Other investments in bonds/debentures, certificate of deposits are fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss to recognise market volatility, which is not considered to be significant. Fixed deposits are held with highly rated banks and companies and have a short tenure and are not subject to interest rate volatility. The Group also invests in mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses. Such investments are susceptible to market price risk that arise mainly from changes in interest rate which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the mutual fund schemes in which the Group has invested, such price risk is not significant. For select agricultural commodities primarily held for trading, futures contracts are used to hedge price risks till positions in the physical market are matched. The carrying value of inventories is adjusted to the extent of fair value movement of the risk being hedged. Such hedges are generally for short time horizons and recognised in profit or loss within the crop cycle and are managed by the business within the approved policy framework. Accordingly, the Group's net exposure to commodity price risk is considered to be insignificant. Foreign currency risk The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currency (mainly US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen) which are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including the Group's net investments in foreign operations (with a functional currency other than Indian Rupee), are also subject to reinstatement risks. The carrying amounts of foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities including derivative contracts (other than in functional currency), are as follows: (F in Crores) As at 31st March, 2023 USD Euro GBP JPY Others Total Financial Assets 1010.94 312.50 66.24 0.27 87.88 1477.83 Financial Liabilities 129.94 32.56 2.44 8.24 7.17 180.35 As at 31st March, 2022 USD Euro GBP JPY Others Total Financial Assets 1035.99 181.07 155.30 0.01 92.67 1465.04 Financial Liabilities 151.30 57.42 26.84 18.26 18.78 272.60 The Group uses foreign exchange forward, futures and options contracts to hedge its exposures in foreign currency arising from firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions. a.

Currency options that were outstanding on respective reporting dates (Designated under Hedge Accounting): (In Million) Currency Cross Currency Buy Sell Buy Sell US Dollar Indian Rupee 8.00 17.00 Hedges of foreign currency risk and derivative financial instruments Each entity comprising the Group manages its own currency risk. Within the Group, derivative instruments are largely entered into by the Company and a subsidiary. The Company and the aforesaid subsidiary has established risk management policies to hedge the volatility in cashflows arising from exchange rate fluctuations in respect of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions, through foreign exchange forward, futures, options contracts and certain non-derivative financial liabilities. The proportion of forecast transactions that are to be hedged is decided based on the size of the forecast transaction and market conditions. As the counterparty for such transactions are primarily highly rated banks or recognised exchange(s), the risk of their non-performance is considered to be insignificant. Where derivatives are not designated under hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of such hedges are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company and one of its subsidiary has designated certain hedges which are entered to manage the volatility in cashflows as a cash flow hedge under hedge accounting. The currency, amount and tenure of such hedges are generally matched to the underlying transaction(s). Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are recognised as cash flow hedging reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. While the probability of such hedges becoming ineffective is very low, the ineffective portion, if any, is immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 308 ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Page 347 OCR: Enduring Value Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 31. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.) The movement in the cash flow hedging reserve in respect of designated cash flow hedges is summarised below: (Rin Crores) Particulars 2023 2022 At the beginning of the year 14.33 4.93 Add: Changes in the fair value of effective portion of matured cash flow hedges during the year (154.16) 16.71 Add: Changes in fair value of effective portion of outstanding cash flow hedges 12.15 19.27 Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on occurrence of forecast hedge transactions during the year (82.63) 30.07 Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss due to cash flows no longer expected to occur (28.19) 3.03 Less: Amounts transferred to initial cost of non-financial assets (10.40) (9.68) Less: Net gain/(loss) transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on ineffectiveness (Less)/Add: Deferred tax 5.23 (3.16) At the end of the year (1.23) 14.33 Oft the above, balances remaining in cash flow hedge reserve for matured hedging relationships (11.20) 2.46 Once the hedged transaction materialises, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will be included in the initial cost of the non-financial hedged item on its initial recognition or reclassified to profit or loss, as applicable, in the anticipated timeframes given below: (Rin Crores) Outstanding balance in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve to be As at As at subsequently recycled from OCI 31st March, 2023 31st March, 2022 Within one year 0.98 10.80 Between one and three years (1.51) 3.53 Beyond three years (0.70) Total (1.23) 14.33 Foreign Currency Sensitivity For every percentage point increase/decrease in the underlying exchange rate of the outstanding foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts, holding all other variables constant, the profit before tax for the year ended 31st March, 2023 would decrease/increase by R 2.72 Crores (2022 R (2.53) Crores) and other equity as at 31st March, 2023 would decrease/increase by R 2.89 Crores (2022 R 38.12 Crores) on a pre-tax basis. Credit Risk Each entity comprising the Group manages its own credit risk. The following explains the processes followed by the Company, being the largest component of the Group, to manage its credit risk: Company's deployment in debt instruments are primarily in Government securities, fixed deposits with highly rated banks and companies; bonds issued by government institutions, public sector undertakings, mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses and certificate of deposits issued by highly rated banks and financial institutions. As these counter parties are Central/State Government, Government institutions/public sector undertakings with investment grade/sovereign credit ratings and taking into account the experience of the Company over time, the counter party risk attached to such assets is considered to be insignificant. The Group's investments that are held at amortised cost stood at R 16422.36 Crores (2022 R 18598.99 Crores). The Company's customer base is large and diverse limiting the risk arising out of credit concentration. Further, credit is extended in business interest in accordance with guidelines issued centrally and business-specific credit policies that are consistent with such guidelines. Exceptions are managed and approved by appropriate authorities, after due consideration of the counterparty's credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions. The Company's historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognized, where considered appropriate by responsible management.

Fair value hierarchy Fair value of the financial instruments is classified in various fair value hierarchies based on the following three levels: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market or Net Asset Value (NAV) for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted price included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using market approach and valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If: significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023 311

Page 350 OCR: Enduring Value Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 31. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.) Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates and forward rates at the end of the reporting period, yield curves, risk free rate of returns, volatility etc., as applicable. The fair value of investment in Bonds/Debentures, Certificate of Deposits, Venture Capital funds etc. and financial liabilities, where applicable, is determined using market observable inputs such as quotes from market participants, value published by the issuer etc. Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the fair value is determined using generally accepted methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparty. The fair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other Current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to the carrying amounts of these items due to their short-term nature. Where such items are Non-current in nature, the same has been classified as Level 3 and fair value determined using discounted cash flow basis. Similarly, unquoted equity instruments where most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements, cost has been considered as best estimate of fair value. There has been no change in the valuation methodology for Level 3 inputs during the year. The Group has not classified any material financial instruments under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact on their value. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year. On behalf of the Board S. PURI Chairman & Managing Director S. DUTTA Director & Chief Financial Officer R. K.

Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 320 ITCLimited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023

Page 359 OCR: Enduring Value Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, the Group, its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Other Matters Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company, in SO far as it relates to these ten subsidiaries, seven associates and two joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures incorporated in India.
