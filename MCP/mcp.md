# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open-source protocol that defines how AI applications `provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs).`

## Purpose

MCP standardizes the connection between AI models and external systems, enabling seamless access to:

- `Data sources`
- `Tools`
- `Workflows`

## What MCP Enables

Using MCP, AI applications (such as ChatGPT or Claude) can connect to:

- **Data Sources**

  - Local files
  - Databases
  - External APIs

- **Tools**

  - Search engines
  - Calculators
  - Custom utilities

- **Workflows**
  - Specialized prompts
  - Automated task flows
  - Contextual pipelines

## Key Benefit

MCP allows AI models to:

- Access relevant external information
- Perform actions using tools
- Operate with richer, real-time context

## Simple Analogy

**MCP is like a USB-C port for AI applications.**

Just as USB-C provides a universal way to connect hardware devices, MCP provides a universal way to connect AI models to external systems and capabilities.

## Why MCP Matters

- Eliminates custom, one-off integrations
- Promotes interoperability across AI tools
- Makes AI systems more powerful, modular, and extensible
